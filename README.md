# Language Learning Utils
This is a collection of tools I use to automate and track my Japanese, Spanish, and Chinese language studies. It contains the following modules:

- `vocab_analyzer` - Analyze and visualize vocab size and amount of target language content consumed.
- `ext_reading` - Generate Anki cards while reading extensively.
- `subs` - Generate Anki cards from movie/TV show subtitles.
- `popup_dict` - Universal pop-up dictionary (WIP).
