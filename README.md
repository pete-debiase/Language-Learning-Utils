# Language Learning Utils
This is a collection of tools I wrote to automate and track my Japanese, Spanish, and Chinese language studies. It contains the following modules:

- Vocab Analyzer: NLP-powered temporal corpora analysis and visualization.
- Extensive Reading: Generate Anki cards while reading extensively.
- SRT: Generate Anki cards from movie/TV show subtitles.
